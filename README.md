# ZimGit
Unrefined and refined code as I go through school

Project Purpose:
ZimGit is a relaxed, low-pressure repository designed for experimenting with Git, practicing version control, and slowly building up coding confidence. It acts as a personal sandbox where learning happens through trial, error, curiosity, and repetition rather than strict structure.

Repository Owner:
Username: SaSuffit
Repository Name: ZimGit

About Me:
I’m a first-year student enrolled in Computer Analytics and Programming. Most of what I do here connects to learning fundamentals, exploring tools, testing ideas, and getting comfortable with how real projects evolve over time.

Current Interests:
I have a broad set of tech and gaming interests that often guide the kind of experiments I run in this repo:

DOS games and retro computing, especially the simplicity and hands-on feel of older systems.

Trying things out in HxD, learning how hexadecimal data shapes files and how tiny edits can change outcomes.

Building early understanding of HTML and CSS, figuring out structure, styling, and the logic that holds the web together.

A genuine love for remixed and community-driven game projects such as TimeSplitters Rewind, Stalker Anomaly, and various fan-made refreshed Pokémon editions. I enjoy how these projects revive classics and encourage creative modding.

What ZimGit Is For:

Practicing Git commands at an easy pace

Exploring branches, commits, merges, and general project flow

Writing small scripts or tests as I grow my coding base

Making messy or experimental commits without fear of breaking anything

Storing notes, learning logs, and random tech thoughts

Tracking progress as I develop my programming skills

How To Use This Repo:

Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SaSuffit/ZimGit.git

Enter the folder
cd ZimGit

Create an experiment branch
git checkout -b something-to-try

Make edits and commit
git add .
git commit -m "small learning step"

Push the branch
git push origin something-to-try

Repo Structure:
src/ – scripts, tests, and small experiments
notes/ – concepts, study notes, random ideas
README.txt – this file

Contributing:
Suggestions and ideas are welcome, but this repo is primarily a personal learning space. Everything here is built around exploration, comfort, and slow, steady skill-building.

Final Thoughts:
ZimGit is meant to grow with me. No deadlines, no pressure — just learning, experimenting, improving, and enjoying the process of becoming better at programming one commit at a time.
